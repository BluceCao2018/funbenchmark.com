In addition to precisely measuring your Reaction Time, this test is affected by the latency of your computer and monitor.  Scores in this Reaction Time Test are faster than the aim trainer test, because you can react instantly without moving the cursor. This is discussed in further detail on the the statistics page about Reaction Time. While an average Reaction Time may fall between 200 - 250ms, your computer could be adding 10 - 50ms on top. If you want, you can keep track of your scores, and see your full history of Reaction Time Test. Just perform at least 5 clicks and then save to record your Reaction Time Test data."
